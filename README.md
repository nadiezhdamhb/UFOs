# UFOs
### Overview of Project:
The Purpose of this project is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. The result will be a webpage using Bootstrap and dynamic table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with visualizations. 

### Results
***The Truth Is Out There!***

The Website allows curious visitors the ability to access information following a possible encounter.

We have the following fields provided on the webpage:


      1. Navigation section to initiate the page
      2. Page header
      3. Description summary and table displaying all information 
      4. Search filters



*Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria*

The site comes with "Search section" to filter the data and show visitors an example of what to enter. You can filter it by Date, City, State, Country, and a Shape. You can also filter one category, then hit```ENTER```, and input the other catergory, then hit ```ENTER```. If you want to start over the filter function, you have to clear up all you filters.



### Summary
 
 Although the website provides great information and it looks interesting, it also has its limitations. For example, I noticed the filter search is case sensitive and if you search for a city it has to be entered exactly how it is shown on the list provided which is not ideal for an easy to navigate webpage.
 
 I would recommend a dropdown list and to add a 'clear' option to clear up the search after you have done your search and wish to do another search.
